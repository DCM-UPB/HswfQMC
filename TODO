Things that can be done without breaking any external example:
 * Fix all exceptions that occur when running a build compiled with: -ffpe-trap=zero,overflow,underflow,invalid

Things to be done which require a pull request with changes to the examples in i-Pi (better all at once):
 * Renaming wf_now.d -> dati_funzione_onda.d in ipi_client (?). Keep rp_now.d in reticolo?
