IMPORTANT:

1) Even though the input files and the folders other than "source" do not contain the code itself, they are essential for running the code.
Please make sure to have a clean folder before committing/pushing. The bash script "command.sh" contains the command "cleanall" to do so.
So, please run "sh command.sh cleanall" before committing/pushing.
